        <p>I'm a passionate Code Crafter...
           — a Fullstack Developer with a sharp eye for clean, scalable, and secure code.

💻 I specialize in building robust fullstack applications using:
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML/CSS, Tailwind, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: Python (Flask, Django), Node.js, SQL/SQLite, REST APIs
- **Other tools**: CLI apps, Git, Linux, VS Code, Postman, ORM (SQLAlchemy), Alembic, JWT/Auth

🛠️ My development style is hands-on, practical, and focused on real-world problem solving. Whether it's:
- A modern e-commerce site
- A custom API system
- A secure CLI-based encryption/decryption tool
- Or a full SaaS dashboard with authentication and email notifications

...I deliver clean, working software that gets the job done. No fluff. Just solid, working code.

🔐 Security-aware: I understand the difference between hashing and encryption. I’ve built secure password systems using `bcrypt` and `cryptography.fernet`, and I always follow best practices when storing sensitive data.

🚀 I'm all about improving, shipping, and leveling up every project I touch. Whether it’s from a blank terminal or a full design spec — I bring the code to life.

📩 Let's build something great — one solid line of code at a time.
